## Introduction
This program is designed to read a CSV file and generate a data visualization dashboard with both a bar plot and a line plot. The visualizations will compare two columns, 'A' and 'B', from the CSV file.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Installation
First, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required packages using pip:

```
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Prepare your CSV file with at least two columns named 'A' and 'B'.
2. Replace the `csv_file` variable in the script with the path to your CSV file. For example:
   ```
   csv_file = 'path/to/your/sample_data.csv'
   ```
3. Run the script. The program will read the CSV file and display a dashboard with two plots:
   - A bar plot of 'A' vs 'B'.
   - A line plot of 'A' vs 'B'.

## Example CSV Format
Your CSV file should have at least two columns, like so:

```
A,B
1,2
3,4
5,6
```

## Visualization Details
- **Bar Plot:** Displays the values of column 'B' as a function of 'A' using bars.
- **Line Plot:** Displays the relationship between columns 'A' and 'B' using a line graph.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure that your CSV file is correctly formatted and located in the path specified in the script.
- Verify that you have the latest versions of Pandas and Matplotlib installed.
